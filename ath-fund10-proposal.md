# IMPACT
## Please describe your proposed solution.
The After Town Hall events aim to create an inclusive and safe space for the Cardano General Community to connect, share ideas, collaborate, and present projects. The focus is on involving individuals from diverse backgrounds and interests within the Cardano ecosystem.
The After Town Hall events occur every Wednesday after the main Town Hall hosted by IOG (Input Output Global) on Zoom. During the main Town Hall, community members receive updates and news about Catalyst, while the After Town Hall provides an opportunity for community members to meet and connect in breakout rooms.

## How does your proposed solution address the challenge and what benefits will this bring to the Cardano ecosystem

## How do you intend to measure the success of your project? 
The success of the After Town Hall depends on the attendance and engagement of the community members in the main Town Hall. To mitigate this risk, close collaboration with IOG (Input Output Global) will ensure that both events remain open spaces for important discussions and presentations in the Cardano ecosystem.

## Please describe your plans to share the outputs and results of your project?
Catalyst Swarm Website: We will update the Catalyst Swarm website with relevant information about the After Town Hall project, including its purpose, format, and achievements. The website will serve as a central hub for accessing resources, recordings, and other relevant materials.
Social Media Channels: We will share updates, highlights, and key outcomes from the After Town Hall sessions using the catalyst swarm social media channels (twitter, youtube, github, gitbook, etc). This will help us reach a broader audience within the Cardano community and beyond.
