# IMPACT
## Please describe your proposed solution.
The After Town Hall events aim to create an inclusive and safe space for the Cardano General Community to connect, share ideas, collaborate, and present projects. The focus is on involving individuals from diverse backgrounds and interests within the Cardano ecosystem.
The After Town Hall events occur every Wednesday after the main Town Hall hosted by IOG (Input Output Global) on Zoom. During the main Town Hall, community members receive updates and news about Catalyst, while the After Town Hall provides an opportunity for community members to meet and connect in breakout rooms.

## How does your proposed solution address the challenge and what benefits will this bring to the Cardano ecosystem

## How do you intend to measure the success of your project? 
The success of the After Town Hall depends on the attendance and engagement of the community members in the main Town Hall. To mitigate this risk, close collaboration with IOG (Input Output Global) will ensure that both events remain open spaces for important discussions and presentations in the Cardano ecosystem.

## Please describe your plans to share the outputs and results of your project?
Catalyst Swarm Website: We will update the Catalyst Swarm website with relevant information about the After Town Hall project, including its purpose, format, and achievements. The website will serve as a central hub for accessing resources, recordings, and other relevant materials.
Social Media Channels: We will share updates, highlights, and key outcomes from the After Town Hall sessions using the catalyst swarm social media channels (twitter, youtube, github, gitbook, etc). This will help us reach a broader audience within the Cardano community and beyond.

# CAPABILITY/ FEASIBILITY
## What is your capability to deliver your project with high levels of trust and accountability?
The ATH Team delivered, up to this date, 93 After TownHall Events, as can be verified in the link After TownHall pipeline Spreadsheet.

## What are the main goals for the project and how will you validate if your approach is feasible?
The main goals for the project are to improve the format, quality, and execution of the After Town Hall (ATH) events, support developers, designers, and projects in the Cardano ecosystem, provide an inclusive and safe space for community members to connect and collaborate, and facilitate the onboarding of newcomers into the community.

To validate the feasibility of the approach, the project team will focus on several key aspects:

Attendance and participation: The success of the ATH is dependent on the community's engagement and participation. The team will track the number of attendees, the level of participation in breakout rooms, and the feedback received from participants to assess the effectiveness of the events.

Community feedback and satisfaction: The project team will actively seek feedback from the community to understand their experiences, identify areas for improvement, and gauge overall satisfaction with the ATH events. This feedback will be collected through surveys, direct communication channels, and engagement in discussions during and after the events.

Onboarding and support: The team will assess the effectiveness of the ATH in onboarding newcomers and providing them with the necessary resources and guidance to get involved in the community. 

Expansion and duplication: The project team has been duplicating and adapting the ATH format to local communities, languages, and cultures. The team will support the establishment and growth of local town halls, assess the level of participation and engagement in these local events, and gather feedback from participants to validate the scalability and replicability of the approach.
