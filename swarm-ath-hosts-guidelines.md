# Swarm After TownHall Hosts Guidelines

## Catalyst Swarm - After Town Hall 

The weekly Catalyst Swarm After Town Halls is a place for the community to present projects, invite the community into meaningful discussions, and find like-minded people to collaborate and build projects together. 

After the official Town Hall, hosted by Daniel Ribar (IOG Community Manager) and Kriss Baird (IOG Product Owner), the Catalyst Swarm and the Community open up the After Town Hall. Each week we have several parallel running breakout rooms in Zoom to invite the community to participate in Presentations, Q&As, Discussions and conversations. Our goal is to maintain spaces where the community can present, meet and connect with each other. 

These events support Project Catalysts goal, to provide a safe and lively environment to explore the highest potential of human Collaboration as well as to onboard, introduce and educate community members to our ecosystem.

Everyone is welcomed to take initiative and host a room.

## Host Guidelines

We have some simple Guidelines to ensure to create and keep After Town Halls inclusive and diverse community events!

Please feel free to upload recordings to your own channel, but as Catalyst Swarm we upload recordings to our Catalyst Swarm Youtube Account to allow everyone to catch up on great discussions, sessions, and workshops. THEN please send an email with a title and description for your recording to coreswarm@gmail.com, Thank You! ‚úå
- **Important ::** As co-host, you are able to close your room when your session is done, but you also able to close all breakout rooms. Do not ‚ÄúClose All Rooms‚Äù when exiting the Zoom call. Please check when leaving to only close your room as we don‚Äôt want to disrupt the conversation going on in parallel in the other breakout rooms.
- Embody Respect with your audience, make sure to read the Community Moderation Guidelines beforehand!
- Act if needed. As After Town Hall Co - host its up to you to maintain a proper communication in your room. If you identify misbehaving participants which do not respect the above mentioned  Community Moderation Guidelines, and which disturb the communication, please take use of your ‚Äúkick participants‚Äù right as a coshost.
