# Catalyst Swarm - After Town Hall

üëã Welcome to the Catalyst Swarm - After Town Hall repository!

The weekly Catalyst Swarm After Town Halls is a place for the community to present projects, invite the community into meaningful discussions, and find like-minded people to collaborate and build projects together. 

After the official Town Hall, hosted by Daniel Ribar (IOG Community Manager) and Kriss Baird (IOG Product Owner), the Catalyst Swarm and the Community open up the After Town Hall. Each week we have several parallel running breakout rooms in Zoom to invite the community to participate in Presentations, Q&As, Discussions and conversations. Our goal is to maintain spaces where the community can present, meet and connect with each other.

## How to Participate

Everyone is welcomed to take initiative and host a room. To sign up to host a room, please fill out the [Breakout Room Submission Form](https://forms.gle/rQrrZSCVEyekF8sG9).

To attend the After Town Hall, simply join the Zoom call at the designated time. You can find the link to the Zoom call in the [Project Catalyst Announcement Telegram](https://t.me/cardanocatalyst) a few hours before the event.

## Host Guidelines

We have some simple Guidelines to ensure to create and keep After Town Halls inclusive and diverse community events!

- Sign up in the [Breakout Room Submission Form](https://forms.gle/rQrrZSCVEyekF8sG9). Your Room and room title/topic will be announced at the end of the Town Hall to the community.
- Check for Daniel Ribar‚Äôs announcement in the [Project Catalyst Announcement Telegram](https://t.me/cardanocatalyst) a couple hours before the Town Hall for confirmation of your Breakout Room.
- Be punctual in the Town Hall 18.00 UTC. To be able to record your room, we will assign you as Co-Host before the rooms open.
- Record your Break Out Room! Upload your recordings to this [folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-FHuAwwG1znyapQyOzqO0y-1RfwoT8V_?usp=sharing). Please upload to the folder within 5 days post ATH recording. Please feel free to upload recordings to your own channel, but as Catalyst Swarm we upload recordings to our Catalyst Swarm Youtube Account to allow everyone to catch up on great discussions, sessions, and workshops. THEN please send an email with a title and description for your recording to coreswarm@gmail.com, Thank You! ‚úå
- Important :: As co-host, you are able to close your room when your session is done, but you also able to close all breakout rooms. Do not ‚ÄúClose All Rooms‚Äù when exiting the Zoom call. Please check when leaving to only close your room as we don‚Äôt want to disrupt the conversation going on in parallel in the other breakout rooms.
- Embody Respect with your audience, make sure to read the [Community Moderation Guidelines](https://github.com/Catalyst-Swarm/Swarm-Wiki/wiki/Community-Moderation-Guidelines) beforehand!
- Act if needed. As After Town Hall Co - host its up to you to maintain a proper communication in your room. If you identify misbehaving participants which do not respect the above mentioned  Community Moderation Guidelines, and which disturb the communication, please take use of your ‚Äúkick participants‚Äù right as a co-host.
