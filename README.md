## What is Swarm After Town Hall?

After the official Town Hall, hosted by Daniel Ribar (IOG Community Manager) and Kriss Baird (IOG Product Owner), the Catalyst Swarm and the community open up the After Town Hall. Each week we have several parallel breakout rooms on Zoom to invite the community to participate in presentations, Q&As, discussions, and conversations. Our goal is to maintain spaces where the community can present, meet, and connect with each other. 

These events support Project Catalyst's goal to provide a safe and lively environment to explore the highest potential of human collaboration, as well as to onboard, introduce, and educate community members to our ecosystem. üåø
